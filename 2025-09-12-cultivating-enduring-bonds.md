New reflection: Cultivating enduring bonds

## Email Body

"Hire good people and get out of their way" is management gospel, but it's incomplete.

I've learned that getting out of their way isn't the same as getting out of their lives. The space between hiring and stepping back is where leadership actually happens.

The best measure of leadership isn't what happens while you're in charge. It's what happens after you leave. Do people keep helping each other? Do the practices persist? Do the relationships endure?

I've discovered the difference between abandonment and supported autonomy. Creating safety for people to admit when they're stuck. Being available without hovering. Removing obstacles quietly.

Once you've created that foundation, the practices that build lasting bonds can take root.
