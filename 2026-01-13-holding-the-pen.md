Hi {{firstName}},

I slept horribly last night. Tossed and turned, didn't get a wink.
Just my luck — everybody is being annoying today.

Wait. I hear myself in that joke.

Is everybody annoying? Or am I filtering for annoyance?

Your filter isn't passive interpretation. It's active construction. When you're exhausted, you notice every interruption. When you're anxious, you spot every potential threat. When you expect resistance, you interpret questions as pushback.

The circumstance didn't change. Your attention did.

This week's reflection explores how patterns become self-fulfilling, how past choices shape present circumstances, and what it means to recognize you're holding the pen.

For most of my life, I believed my story was written by an unseen hand. I was the narrative, not the author.

I've read the Stoics. "You are how you react to your circumstances." It never really clicked. It felt like a mental jump to just "be better" about accepting things.

The switch happened for me when I realized our past choices shape our present circumstances, and our present choices shape our future ones. Not the events themselves, but which ones we notice, how we interpret them, what patterns we let them reinforce.

I was the one holding the pen.

If I can pencil myself into a panic, I certainly should be able to purple crayon myself out of it.

In leadership, the stakes multiply. The leader who filters for threat creates defensive teams. The leader who filters for potential creates exploratory teams. Same circumstances. Different filters. Different realities.

The filter doesn't just shape what I notice. It shapes how I think I'm supposed to act. I catch myself playing the part my circumstances seem to demand. Somewhere I learned that society expected a certain performance, so I stuck to the script. The script became the path I followed without questioning if it was true.

But anything learned can be unlearned. The work is patient, unglamorous, and constant: redirecting attention each time the reflex fires. Choosing a different data point to surface. Building a new default through accumulated micro-decisions.

You can't control what happens. But you can control what you're scanning for. This is an act of curation — of stewardship for yourself and your world.

The circumstance is real. The filter is adjustable.

What you look for becomes what you find. I choose to choose carefully.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
