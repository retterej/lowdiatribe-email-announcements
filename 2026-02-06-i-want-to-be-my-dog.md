Hi {{firstName}},

I want to be my dog.

Not in some whimsical "wouldn't it be nice" way. I mean it. I watch my French Bulldog move through the world and I see something I've lost. Something I'm trying to find again.

Henri's the bravest, friendliest creature I know. And he doesn't carry stories forward.

Someone steps on his paw, he yelps, he moves. Five minutes later, that person is his favorite person again. No grudge. No narrative about what it means. No filter that says "this person is dangerous" or "I should be more careful around them."

Just: that hurt, now it doesn't, moving on.

---

I was talking to a good friend the other day and found myself saying "I feel broken and need fixing."

Watching Henri heal from a hurt paw, I realized that's mechanical language, not human language.

Broken implies defective. Something wrong with the design. Needs repair to return to factory specs.

Wounded implies hurt. Natural response to injury. Needs care to heal. Might become whole again, possibly different than before.

Henri doesn't think he's broken when he's hurt. He just heals.

---

I've spent years building filters. Learning what to attend to, what to ignore. How to perform. How to carry stories forward so I don't make the same mistake twice.

The filters protected me. They helped me navigate. Helped me build competency.

But somewhere along the way, they stopped being tools and became walls. I stopped responding to what is. I started responding to what I've learned to expect. To stories I'm carrying about what things mean.

Henri doesn't do that. My six-year-old autistic grandson doesn't do that. They both move through the world without the weight of accumulated stories. They respond to what is.

---

I can't actually become Henri. I can't unlearn everything and return to some imagined state of pure presence.

But I'm learning to notice when I'm responding to the story instead of the moment. To catch myself saying "broken" and choose "wounded" instead.

"The filters aren't the enemy. They're just tools that became walls."

Henri can't choose when to use his filters because he doesn't have any to set down. But I do. And that's not a curse. It's a choice.

---

I want to be Henri because he reminds me of something I've forgotten.

That presence is possible. That wounds heal. That you don't have to carry every story forward. That bread or no bread, you can just be here.

I'm wounded, not broken. And wounded things heal.
