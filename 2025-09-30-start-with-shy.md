Sometimes the best leadership advice comes from a typo.

I was writing about Simon Sinek's "Start with Why" when my fingers betrayed me: "Start with shy." I stared at those words on the screen, and something clicked. That's exactly what I do.

Most leadership frameworks assume you'll charge into rooms with your purpose blazing like a banner. But what if your experiences have wired you to listen first? What if that pause isn't hesitation but sophisticated social sensing?

In this week's reflection, I explore how shyness in leadership isn't about lacking confidence—it's about having enough confidence to not need immediate validation. It's finding your way to purpose through the side quest of reading the room through a lens of curiosity.

The shy approach doesn't replace Sinek's framework. It finds it at a different speed, using the space between action for reflection.
