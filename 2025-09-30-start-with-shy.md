Hi {{firstName}},

Sometimes the best leadership advice comes from a typo. I was writing about Simon Sinek's "Start with Why" when my fingers betrayed me: "Start with shy." Instead of correcting it, I sat with those words. That mistake became a framework for leadership that seeks clarity through connection first.

This reflection explores how shyness in leadership isn't about lacking confidence. It's about having enough confidence to not need immediate validation. It's finding your way to purpose through the side quest of reading the room through a lens of curiosity.

"The shy approach doesn't replace the why. It seeks clarity through connection first."

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
