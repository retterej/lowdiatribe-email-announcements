Hi {{firstName}},

Three pink blobs with flappy yellow beaks. That's what my wife brought in after the storm — freshly hatched, eyes sealed shut, barely breathing. She had found them scattered in the yard among the fallen branches, their nest somewhere in the wreckage above.

The next morning, two had gone quiet. One kept screaming.

Our latest reflection explores the profound lessons learned from rescuing and raising Valya, a starling who chose connection over independence. Through this intimate story of imprinting and growth, we examine what it means to lead with curiosity rather than control.

Six weeks later, Valya was strong enough to fly anywhere she chose. But she chose here. This house, these people who answered her first cries. She built her world around the relationship that saved her.

There's something profound in watching a creature grow from complete dependence to capable independence while choosing connection. Leadership often feels like the inverse of this story — we start with connection and somehow end up with people who've learned to survive on their own but forgotten why they chose to stay.

"Maybe that's what we're really building when we lead well. Not just capable people, but people who choose to stay not because they have to, but because they remember who answered when they called."

But there's another layer: how to genuinely lead with curiosity instead of frustration. Being a mammal, I find a bird's motives completely foreign. When Valya suddenly flies to the ceiling and won't come down, I've learned to approach these moments with genuine curiosity rather than the need to fix or control.

This shift has been profound. The same patience I've developed for Valya's bird logic has opened space for the equally alien but equally valid logic of an autistic five-year-old.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
