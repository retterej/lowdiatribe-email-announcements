# Reset

The new year invites resolutions. Goals. Grand declarations of transformation.

But what I need is reset.

Not a new destination. A recalibration of what I notice. What I let dominate the frame.

## The Tralfamadorian Choice

I don't remember exactly when I first read Slaughterhouse-Five. Somewhere around four decades ago. The thing that stuck wasn't the time travel or the war or even "So it goes."

It was the Tralfamadorians and their choice.

They experience all of time at once. Every joy, every cruelty, every ordinary Thursday exists simultaneously. That could lead to paralysis, nihilism, or cold detachment. Instead, they do something quietly radical: they select where to place their attention. They linger in a moment worth keeping. They choose the zoo.

That decision matters more than their perception of time. Omniscience isn't the power. Selection is.

## The Yellow Experiment

Think about the color yellow.

If you decide, consciously, to look for yellow, something odd happens. You don't buy more yellow things. The world doesn't repaint itself. But suddenly yellow is everywhere: signs, jackets, flowers, packaging, license plates. It feels like it has multiplied.

It hasn't. Your attention has shifted.

The moment you choose "yellow matters," your perception aligns to reveal it. Not because you're imagining things, but because your mind is constantly filtering reality, and you've changed the filter. What was always present becomes suddenly dense.

## What Compounds

What you attend to shapes what you interpret.
What you interpret shapes what you reinforce.
What you reinforce becomes culture — internal or shared.

If I, as a leader, only notice what's broken, the room fills with fracture. If I, as a parent, only notice what's missing, the household hums with lack. If I only notice where I fell short, the timeline collapses inward around regret.

None of those perceptions are false. But they are incomplete.

The Tralfamadorians offer a different discipline: acknowledge the whole, choose the center.

## My Reset

I'm writing this on January 2nd, which means I'm two days into a choice I made deliberately.

Not a resolution. Not a goal. A reset of attention.

I'm choosing to notice what's working. To treat setbacks as information rather than indictment. To look for the yellow instead of cataloging the gray.

The work doesn't change. I still have to do the things required to survive, to provide, to show up. The bills don't care about my attention. The responsibilities don't pause while I recalibrate.

But I can direct my attention while doing that work. Notice the movement instead of staring at the weight. The progress, however small. The pace, however slow. Not because it makes the work easier, but because it makes the work sustainable.

## Building Superstitions

The stories we tell ourselves become the superstitions we live by. If I tell myself I'm always behind, I'll find evidence everywhere. If I tell myself nothing I do matters, I'll stop noticing when it does. The narrative becomes the filter. The filter becomes the world.

I'm trying to consciously build more positive superstitions. Not delusions. But patterns of attention that surface what's working, what's holding, what's moving forward. Stories grounded in truth but oriented toward possibility.

I've been practicing this for a while now, in small ways. I stopped watching horror movies, even my favorites. The dread lingered. The tension stayed in my body for days. I've pulled back from music that feeds on angst — even bands I love, even songs that feel like home. Not forever. There's a time for catharsis, but it should be chosen, not constant. I'd rather my default state be cultivating joy than exploring dread.

## The Practice

So that's my reset. Quiet, unglamorous, repeated daily.

Deciding where to stand inside the timeline I've already got.
