Hi {{firstName}},

The new year invites resolutions. Goals. Grand declarations of transformation.

But what I need is reset.

Not a new destination. A recalibration of what I notice. What I let dominate the frame.

This week's reflection explores the Tralfamadorian choice from Slaughterhouse-Five, the power of attention, and the quiet practice of choosing where to stand inside the timeline we've already got.

In Slaughterhouse-Five, the Tralfamadorians experience all of time at once. Every joy, every cruelty, every ordinary Thursday exists simultaneously. That could lead to paralysis, nihilism, or cold detachment. Instead, they do something quietly radical: they select where to place their attention. They linger in a moment worth keeping. They choose the zoo.

That decision matters more than their perception of time. Omniscience isn't the power. Selection is.

Think about the color yellow. If you decide, consciously, to look for yellow, something odd happens. You don't buy more yellow things. The world doesn't repaint itself. But suddenly yellow is everywhere. Your attention has shifted.

What you attend to shapes what you interpret. What you interpret shapes what you reinforce. What you reinforce becomes culture — internal or shared.

If I, as a leader, only notice what's broken, the room fills with fracture. If I, as a parent, only notice what's missing, the household hums with lack. The Tralfamadorians offer a different discipline: acknowledge the whole, choose the center.

I'm two days into a choice I made deliberately. Not a resolution. A reset of attention. I'm choosing to notice what's working. To treat setbacks as information rather than indictment. To look for the yellow instead of cataloging the gray.

The work doesn't change. But I can direct my attention while doing that work. Notice the movement instead of staring at the weight. Not because it makes the work easier, but because it makes the work sustainable.

The stories we tell ourselves become the superstitions we live by. I'm trying to consciously build more positive superstitions. Not delusions. But patterns of attention that surface what's working, what's holding, what's moving forward. Stories grounded in truth but oriented toward possibility.

There's a time for catharsis, but it should be chosen, not constant. I'd rather my default state be cultivating joy than exploring dread.

So that's my reset. Quiet, unglamorous, repeated daily. Deciding where to stand inside the timeline I've already got.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
