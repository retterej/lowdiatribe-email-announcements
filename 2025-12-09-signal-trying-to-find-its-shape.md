Hi {{firstName}},

I was flipping through a People magazine in a waiting room the other day — something I hadn't done in years — and it hit me: this was the feed before the feed. The glossy pages represented an early algorithm. Quick stories. Familiar faces. Bite-sized connection.

This week's reflection explores how our desire to peek into other lives hasn't changed, just the medium. On a road trip with my grandson, we pulled into a hotel room after a long day of driving. My first impulse was to turn on the TV. His was to open his iPad and pull up YouTube Shorts. Same need, different window.

We like to think of short-form video — TikTok, Reels, Shorts, whatever the platform — as a modern attention disaster. But in truth, it's just the next step in a long line of human patterning. The impulse that made us flip through People or tune in to America's Funniest Home Videos hasn't changed. The medium changed. The curiosity didn't.

But handing someone the glass doesn't mean they'll know how to look through it. It was easier to distinguish between sources like People and the Wall Street Journal, but our feeds blur that line.

I've felt the trap. Falling asleep watching a movie on the couch, then checking my phone in bed. Suddenly it's 45 minutes later and I'm watching yet another video of someone refinish an antique pasta roller. The feed found my curiosity and turned it into compulsion.

The algorithm isn't a villain; it's an amplifier. It gives back what we reward. Every tap trains it — so what we feed it becomes what it feeds us. We decide whether the feed becomes a mirror or a maze.

The reflection examines how we build our own algorithms too — as individuals, as teams, as organizations — rewarding behavior that gets attention rather than behavior that builds value. We promote volume, not resonance. We treat the loudest updates as the most important ones.

If we want better content, we can start by becoming better curators of our own attention. Follow what makes you curious, not what makes you restless. Scroll until something slows you down, then stay there a while.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
