Hi {{firstName}},

The US Mint has never officially coined a "penny" — the designation has always been "one-cent piece" or "cent." Yet they are universally referred to as the "penny."

There's a leadership lesson buried in this stubborn persistence of the "wrong" word.

Our latest reflection explores the relationship between authority and reality through the lens of language. When the US Mint announces they are retiring the cent, all the coverage is about the penny, all the talk is about the penny, the official footage of the mint pressing the LAST PENNY.

I've watched leaders exhaust themselves fighting cultural momentum instead of working with it. The executive who mandates that all project updates flow through formal status meetings while the team has organically developed targeted conversations — quick hallway check-ins, focused Slack threads, coffee-break problem-solving sessions — that actually move work forward.

Sometimes being right becomes a barrier to being effective.

The penny won despite never being official because it felt more natural, more human-scaled than "cent." It stuck because it worked better in the mouth, in conversation, in the daily reality of how people actually talk about small change. No committee decided this. No authority figure decreed it. It just happened, the way water finds its level.

This is how culture actually works — not through official channels and formal decisions, but through the accumulated weight of millions of small choices. Each person who says "penny" instead of "cent" is casting a vote in an election that never ends.

Effective leaders understand this invisible democracy. They recognize when they're fighting a tide that's stronger than their authority. They learn to distinguish between hills worth defending and battles that reveal they've lost touch with their own culture.

"In the end, the penny persisted not because it was right, but because it was real. And sometimes, in leadership as in language, real matters more than right."
