Hi {{firstName}},

I came of age when punctuation mattered. Teachers circled commas in red. Editors debated serial oxford usage like philosophers. A well-placed em dash wasn't a flourish — it was a gesture of rhythm. It let a sentence breathe, let a thought take a human pause.

Recently a friend and mentor warned me that there was a growing perception of em dash usage being a red flag for AI-generated content. So I stopped using them. I agonizingly reframed thoughts to avoid what would otherwise flow naturally.

The irony isn't lost on me. AI learned its tone from us — fed on centuries of properly structured and punctuated prose. From writers who cared enough about clarity to give each idea a little air. Now, to sound human, I'm supposed to avoid the very precision that made us human in the first place.

This reflection explores the strange loop we've created: authenticity through imperfection, imperfection through imitation, imitation through data scraped from perfection. It's about how we've mistaken looseness for authenticity and brokenness for voice. How in the rush to sound "natural," we flatten what made human writing musical in the first place.

"The em dash, for me, is rebellion. A pause that refuses to be rushed. It's the space between reaction and response. The pause that separates correction from understanding, urgency from clarity."

I see this same pattern in leadership. We've optimized our communication to the point of compression. Slack threads instead of dialogue. Bullet points instead of nuance. Every message trimmed for speed — clarity lost in the cut.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
