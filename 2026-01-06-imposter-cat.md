Hi {{firstName}},

A handful of years ago, at 3 in the morning, a big fluffy orange cat mewled at our back door. I let him in. He was covered in burrs, his fur matted. "What did you get into, Ruckus?" I spent the better part of an hour cleaning him up, then went back to bed.

Three days later, our son walked upstairs carrying the big fluffy orange cat. "This isn't Ruckus," he said to my wife.

"Stop joking," she replied.

"This isn't Ruckus. This cat has white paws, but Ruckus is all orange." He paused. "Plus Ruckus is neutered, and this cat has balls."

I had let a stray doppelganger into the house. He'd pretended to be Ruckus for three days. Or rather, we thought he'd pretended — we have no actual visibility into the ways of cats.

This week's reflection explores what happened when Maurice (né Imposter, or Moss for short) came back after being gone for over a year — and what it's teaching me about grace, judgment, and the environments that change us.

For years, Moss lived at our house. He wasn't friendly to humans or cats as far as I could see. He never seemed to like it here. But he called this house home and never left.

Then our daughter had a mouse problem. We jokingly suggested she could have a fluffy orange cat — we had a spare. She said yes. We expected a message asking us to come get him immediately.

Instead: photos. Videos. A running commentary on how he's her perfect baby kitty boy and how much she loves him. He was a genuinely changed feline.

Until this month, when our daughter moved into a new place that won't allow cats. Could Maurice come back?

Moss's first five minutes back in the house: he picked a fight with not one, but two of the elder cats. The ones who'd been here all along, the ones who remembered him.

I find myself trying to fix it like a leadership problem. I can't. They're cats. But I can learn from it.

If I expect Moss to be a nuisance, I'm hyper-aware of every little infraction. If I extend him the grace to acclimate to a new environment, I start to notice all the peaceful interactions he's had with the dogs. How he was actually hunting mice here, as opposed to the elder cats, who are either incredibly lazy or running a mouse protection racket.

The work isn't fixing Moss. The work is noticing when I'm treating him like a problem to be solved instead of a creature adjusting to circumstances he didn't choose.

The work is catching myself in the act of confirmation bias: looking for evidence that he's difficult, that this won't work, that we made a mistake taking him back.

How often do I do this with people?

Expect difficulty and find it everywhere. Interpret every action through the lens of past behavior. Forget that environments change people. Forget that people who struggled in one context might thrive in another. Forget that coming back is harder than leaving.

Moss was a different cat at our daughter's house. Not because he changed his nature, but because the environment allowed different parts of his nature to emerge. Now he's back in a place that holds old patterns, old conflicts, old expectations. Of course he's struggling. Of course he's defensive.

The question isn't whether he'll be the cat he was at our daughter's house. The question is whether I can create enough space for him to find his way in this environment.

I'm learning to notice the moment when I shift from observation to judgment. When I move from "Moss hissed at the other cat" to "Moss is the problem." That shift happens fast. Faster than I'd like to admit.

Maybe Moss does the same thing. Maybe he doesn't pick fights with the elder cats because he's aggressive, but because he's struggling with something he can't name or fix. Transferring his frustration onto available targets.

I recognize that pattern. I do it too.

The practice is catching it, just noticing: I'm doing the thing again. I'm making this harder than it needs to be. Then choosing differently.

Extending grace I don't feel. Assuming good intent I have no evidence for. Creating space for adjustment I can't control. It's the only way forward that doesn't make me smaller.

Maurice/Moss, né Imposter, is teaching me that we're all in constant flux. Hopefully growing toward something better, but always changing. Always adjusting to circumstances we didn't choose and systems we can't control.

And that the change itself deserves grace. Not just in others, but in ourselves.

I'm struggling too, in my own way, with a system that changed while he was gone and changed again when he returned. I need time to adjust. Space to find my way. The same patience I'm trying to extend to him.

The same willingness to see what's actually happening instead of what I expect to happen.

I can't fix this. I can only show up as my best self and let the system settle. That takes practice. More important than I realized. And necessary in ways I'm still learning.
