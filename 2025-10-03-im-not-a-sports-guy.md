Hi {{firstName}},

"I'm not a sports guy." That was my stock response whenever someone recommended Ted Lasso. I saw the hype, dismissed it as a sports show, and moved on. Classic identity-as-shield behavior.

The winter after season 3, my new boss said what others had: "You remind me of Coach Beard. It's a good thing." I'd heard that before, but this time I understood it was a compliment and let my guard down. Alone in a hotel room, I finally listened. One binge later, I was hooked. Not just on the show, but on what followed: Premier League football, Pep Guardiola's philosophy, leadership books by Sir Alex Ferguson and Carlo Ancelotti that became a new way understanding authentic influence.

This reflection explores how self-limiting assumptions can close us off from transformative experiences. It's about the Coach Beard leadership archetype, the quiet enabler who creates conditions for others to shine. And it's about learning to be delighted by the surprise when authentic influences arrive from unexpected directions.

"As a leader, this means creating space for people to discover their own unexpected connections rather than assuming what will or won't work for them."

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
