Hi {{firstName}},

The gap between how we think we're perceived and how we're actually received is almost always wider than we imagine.

I've watched this play out in myself and in every leader I've worked with. We construct elaborate narratives about our weaknesses, our gaps, the ways we don't measure up. We become convinced that everyone sees what we see when we look in the mirror at 3am.

The superstition goes like this: I notice my hesitation in that meeting, so everyone must see me as uncertain. I stumble over my words in that presentation, so they must think I'm unprepared. I don't have all the answers, so they must question whether I belong here.

This week's reflection explores the stories we tell ourselves about how we're perceived, the superstitions we inherit without questioning, and the radical act of trusting that people see us more clearly — and more kindly — than we see ourselves.

We take our internal experience — the doubt, the second-guessing, the imposter syndrome — and project it outward as fact. We assume our anxiety is visible, our uncertainty obvious, our struggles transparent.

But most of the time? People aren't seeing what we think they're seeing.

Later I learn that my hesitation was read as thoughtfulness. That my stumbling over words came across as genuine enthusiasm. That asking questions signaled curiosity and growth, not ignorance. The flaws I was certain disqualified me were barely noticed — or noticed and interpreted as something else entirely.

The superstition breaks down when you realize: everyone is too busy managing their own internal narrative to scrutinize yours.

The superstition we build about ourselves is almost always harsher than reality. And maybe the most radical thing we can do is stop believing our own superstitions — and start trusting that people see us more clearly, and more kindly, than we see ourselves.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
