Hi {{firstName}},

From childhood dreams of an astromech best friend to today's AI boom. This reflection examines AI as amplifier, magnifying both signal and noise, shortcuts and learning. It all depends on how we choose to engage. Through mentoring experiences and hands-on development work, it draws a picture of how AI can either replace understanding or enhance it.

"AI can excel as an assistant but it is no better or worse than the user's intent."

How do we navigate this amplification thoughtfully?

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
