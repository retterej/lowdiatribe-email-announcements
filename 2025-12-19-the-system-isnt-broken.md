Hi {{firstName}},

The Eldridge City Council voted 3-2 this week to close our community skating rink. Dozens of citizens spoke. The council denied a referendum and decided themselves.

Everyone keeps saying "the system is broken."

I don't think that's right. The system is working perfectly — doing exactly what it was designed to do. Allow a small group to make decisions for everyone else. Prioritize financial metrics over community value. Treat public resources like business assets.

The system isn't broken. It's just designed to optimize for the wrong things.

This week's reflection explores fear-based governance, selective liability, and our responsibility to redesign inherited systems. The rink has been home to my family for decades — all seven children learned to skate there, all six grandchildren. The QC Cuttaz. The Quad City Rollers for twenty years.

But this isn't just about a skating rink. It's about whether systems serve people, or people serve systems. Whether we make decisions based on fear, or out of hope. Whether we accept inherited design as inevitable, or recognize our responsibility to refine what we've been given.

The liability argument troubles me most. We're making decisions based on fear of liability, when that liability itself is manufactured. It exists because we've privatized healthcare. If someone gets hurt, the medical bills are so astronomical that a sizable lawsuit becomes the only way to cover them.

We've created a system where the cost of an injury is so high that the fear of that cost drives us to eliminate the activity itself. Then we point to that fear as if it's natural law, rather than recognizing it as a design choice we made.

The most hopeful thing I've witnessed: the activism from younger generations. They understand something easy to forget — systems are human-made. Which means they're human-editable.
