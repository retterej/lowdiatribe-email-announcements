Hi {{firstName}},

"I need your help," she said. "How do you do it? How do you present at these huge meetings? I'm terrified to speak up in those kinds of situations."

She was a talented engineer I'd been mentoring. Sharp, capable, the kind of person who made everyone around her better. But she didn't feel comfortable voicing her ideas in large group settings.

She was looking for the secret. The technique that would make the fear go away.

I didn't have one.

"I'm scared too," I told her. "I do it anyway."

I have almost the same level of anxiety calling a restaurant as I do speaking in front of large crowds. Calling to place a takeout order triggers the same internal alarm as a keynote presentation.

Anxiety is anxiety, regardless of stakes.

People see the performance and assume it means something about the internal experience. They see confidence and mistake it for the absence of fear.

But confidence isn't the absence of fear. It's acting despite it.

There's a misconception about courage that we carry from childhood. We're taught that brave people aren't afraid. That heroes feel no fear. That confidence means certainty.

It's a lie that keeps people frozen.

I'm not fearless. I'm practiced at carrying fear while still moving forward.

My dad used to tell a story about how I learned to walk. I wouldn't let anyone see me learning. I'd practice alone, fall over and over, then sit down the moment someone entered the room. One day I just walked out, having mastered it in secret.

I spent decades operating that way. Perfect it in private. Only perform when polished. Never let them see you fall.

Somewhere along the way, I realized that pattern was keeping me frozen. The things worth doing don't wait for you to master them in secret. They require you to fall in front of people. To shake visibly. To admit "I'm scared too" and do it anyway.

After our conversation, she presented at the next big meeting. Her voice shook. She kept going.

"I was terrified the whole time," she told me afterward.

"I know," I said. "And you did it anyway."

That's not a lesser version of courage. It's the only version that exists.

I still get anxious before presentations. I still dread making phone calls. The fear hasn't diminished with practice. What's changed is my willingness to let it stop me, and I still have to work at that.

Not overcoming. Not conquering. Just carrying.
