Hi {{firstName}},

I spent the last half of the 90s in Minneapolis. I lived two blocks from the corner of 26th St and Nicollet Ave.

If that intersection sounds familiar, it's where Alex Jeffrey Pretti was pepper sprayed and thrown to the ground, then beaten by six masked ICE agents, then shot to death. All of this in front of dozens of witnesses, several of them capturing the entire altercation on video.

This happened January 24, 2026. Twenty-five years after I moved away.

I can still walk those two blocks in my mind. The route to the corner store, the sound of traffic on that street, the way light hit the buildings in late afternoon. I haven't lived there in 25 years, but the geography is still mapped in my body.

When violence happens in a place you used to inhabit, it collapses time. The news says "Minneapolis" and my brain supplies the specific intersection, the specific distance, the specific texture of that neighborhood. It's not abstract. It's the place I bought milk.

Dozens of people saw it happen. Several recorded it. The witnesses aren't just evidence. They're people who now have to live with what they saw. When we look away, witnesses carry the full weight alone. When we engage, when we refuse denial, when we insist on accountability — we distribute the load. We say: you saw something real, and we see it too. We see you.

I was 19 when Rodney King was beaten by Los Angeles police while George Holliday's camera captured it from his apartment balcony. That grainy video changed something. It cracked open the possibility that what we'd been told about authority and protection might not match what was actually happening.

The violence was always there. It just wasn't being shown to people who looked like me. People from historically excluded groups had been warning us for generations. They were systematically silenced, dismissed, erased.

That was 1991. Thirty-five years ago. And we're still here.

I've spent years exploring what legitimate authority looks like. What it means to lead without hiding. What it takes to build trust instead of demanding it. Watching this unfold two blocks from where I used to live makes the contrast impossible to ignore.

Legitimate authority doesn't wear masks. It doesn't hide behind anonymity or institutional protection. It stands visible, accountable, willing to be identified and questioned.

Legitimate authority doesn't deny what's documented. It acknowledges hard truths, even when they're uncomfortable. Especially when they're uncomfortable. Because trust isn't built through denial — it's built through the willingness to face what's real.

Legitimate authority doesn't require intimidation or violence to maintain itself. It earns respect through consistency, through accountability, through the daily practice of doing what it says it will do.

The masks tell you everything. When authority hides its face, it knows it's doing something it can't defend in daylight.

Alex Pretti is gone. Renée Good is gone.

They are the two most visibly documented of at least seven people who have died in ICE custody or operations in the first 24 days of 2026. Geraldo Lunas Campos. Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz. Parady La. Heber Sanchez Domínguez. Victor Manuel Diaz.

This is just January.

They join a long line of names: Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell, Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Philando Castile, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Tyre Nichols, Sonya Massey. Names that should never be forgotten.

No one deserves to be executed in the street. Not for their documentation status. Not for exercising their rights. Not for anything.

It's up to us to make this the last straw, to stop all future ones. The line must be drawn here. This far, and no further.

My body remembers those Minneapolis streets. My grandchildren will map their own streets, their own places, their own memories. I want them to grow up in a world where authority doesn't hide behind masks. Where documented truth matters more than institutional denial. Where the places they love don't get rewritten by violence they're told didn't happen. Where the rights given to us by us apply to all of us, without exception.

That world doesn't build itself. It's built through the daily practice of refusing to look away. Of insisting on accountability. Of modeling the kind of authority that earns trust instead of demanding it.

Thirty-five years from Rodney King to Alex Pretti. I don't want my grandchildren marking another thirty-five years of the same cycle. The line is here. The work starts now.
