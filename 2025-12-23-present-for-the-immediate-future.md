Hi {{firstName}},

I caught myself saying it out loud: "I'm not feeling motivated to do anything."

Then I looked at what I was actually doing. Researching jobs. Working through house projects. Playing elf to plan a festive family celebration.

I wasn't lacking motivation. I was lacking inspiration.

The motivation was there in the doing. What I missed was the feeling of wanting to do it — the spark, the enthusiasm, the sense that any of it mattered beyond the immediate need to get it done.

**Motivation isn't what you feel before you do something. It's what you call it after you've done it anyway.**

Inspiration is the feeling. Motivation is the motion. You can have one without the other.

This week's reflection explores the triple meaning of "present" (gift, now, showing up), why shrinking scope is honesty rather than failure, and what it means to lead when you don't feel inspired.

The holiday season carries this weight of expectation: be generous, be present, show up for people. And I find myself struggling with all three. Not because I don't care. Because the scope of everything feels too large.

So I've been shrinking my focus. Not as strategy. As survival. What can I handle right now? What needs attention in the next hour? The next day? The immediate future becomes the only future I can manage.

Here's what I'm learning: focusing on immediate needs is necessary. But it can't be the only thing. I need to give myself permission to do something outside the immediate needs. Not because it's urgent. Because it matters. Find the things to keep from collapsing my world too far.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
