Hi {{firstName}},

I used to take pride in being good at everything I did.

Not in an arrogant way. Just a quiet confidence that whatever I attempted, I could do well. I'd built a reputation around it. The person who could pick up new things quickly, who delivered quality work, who made it look easy.

It occurred to me recently that the only reason I was good at everything I did was because I'd stopped doing things I wasn't good at.

---

The pattern was subtle. I'd try something new. If it came naturally, if I showed early promise, I'd keep going. But if I struggled, if I felt incompetent, if it didn't click quickly — I'd find reasons to stop.

Not dramatic reasons. Just... other priorities. Time constraints. "Not really my thing." The gentle drift away from discomfort.

Over time, my life narrowed to the things I was already good at. And because I only did things I was good at, I built the narrative that I was good at everything. It was a curation of what I chose to attempt.

I started drawing again about a year ago. Picked up a pencil after years away. I could see what I wanted to create — the shapes were clear in my mind. But my hand wouldn't cooperate. The gap between vision and execution felt humiliating.

I tapered off. Not a dramatic decision. Just... frustration. Other priorities. The quiet drift back to things I was already good at.

But I've learned I can selectively push through it. When I joined my skate crew, I could barely skate backwards. I fell. Got back up. Pushed through the awkwardness of being a beginner in front of people who'd been skating for years.

The difference wasn't the difficulty. It was the context. With skating, I had a crew. Social encouragement and accountability that made walking away harder than staying. With drawing, I was alone.

I'm learning that I'm selective about which incompetence I'm willing to endure. And that selectivity has shaped my life more than I realized.

Watching my grandson reminded me what I'd lost.

He's six. Autistic. Doesn't have filters yet. And he tries everything. He's terrible at a lot of things. Spectacularly, joyfully terrible. He doesn't care. He's not performing competence. He's just trying things.

I watch my middle grandson learning the same lesson I did. He's eight. Already building the filters. Already avoiding things that might make him look foolish.

I want to show him something different. Not by telling him it's okay to be a beginner. But by being a beginner myself. By letting him see me struggle with drawing. With guitar. With things that don't come naturally.

The Japanese have a word for this: shoshin. Beginner's mind.

The cost of experience isn't that you stop learning. It's that you stop being willing to be a beginner.

I'm trying to practice this now. Drawing daily. Playing guitar again. Learning to ollie. Attempting conversations I'm not sure how to navigate.

I used to take pride in being good at everything I did.

Now I'm learning to take pride in being willing to be bad at new things.

That's a different kind of competence. And with my grandchildren watching, a more important one.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
