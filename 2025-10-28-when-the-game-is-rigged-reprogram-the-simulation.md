Hi {{firstName}},

I remember hundreds of hours spent playing Monopoly growing up, and nearly as many hours fighting about it. The game usually ended when someone flipped the board in frustration. Even as a kid, something felt wrong about a system where winning required making everyone else lose.

What I learned later makes it even more troubling: Monopoly was based on Elizabeth Magie's 1904 educational game called The Landlord's Game. She designed it with two rule sets — one showing how monopolistic thinking eliminates players, another demonstrating cooperative alternatives where shared prosperity replaced zero-sum competition. When Parker Brothers bought the game in 1935, they kept only the monopolistic version. Magie's cooperative rules disappeared entirely.

This same pattern plays out in modern business systems. We've built structures that reward finite thinking over infinite games, quarterly extraction over generational building. Leaders who think in decades get punished by markets that think in quarters.

"The challenge isn't choosing between infinite and finite thinking but learning to play infinite games within finite systems. This requires a different kind of strategic thinking."

This reflection explores how the most effective leaders develop "nested game awareness" — understanding they're playing multiple games simultaneously across different time horizons. They find ways to hit quarterly targets while building capabilities that won't pay off for years. They make decisions that preserve trust and reputation even when shortcuts are available.

The best way to win finite games is to play infinite games. After all, the goal shouldn't be to bankrupt everyone else. It's to build something that lasts.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
