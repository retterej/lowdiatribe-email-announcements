Hi {{firstName}},

We've abandoned perfectly good words because they became buzzwords. But what if the problem isn't the words themselves? What if it's that we stopped agreeing on what they mean?

This week's reflection explores "mindful solutionism" — a phrase I'm reclaiming from Aesop Rock's ironic critique of tech culture for something more earnest: the practice of slowing down to fully understand a problem before rushing to fix it.

Early in my career, I replaced a perfectly good ethernet cable with wireless just because wireless was new. Classic solutionism: applying solutions because they're exciting, not because they're needed. That moment taught me something about how we abandon good language for the same reason — not because the words failed us, but because we stopped being precise about what they mean.

The reflection explores the tension between avoiding corrupted terms entirely versus reclaiming them through clarity. It's about the discipline to ask: is this actually a problem? For whom? What are we optimizing for?

In a world that profits from confusion, precision becomes an act of resistance.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
