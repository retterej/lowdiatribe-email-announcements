Hi {{firstName}},

There's something unsettling about the questions we don't ask about the questions we do ask.

On a recent Wednesday I had what felt like a great interview. Good energy, thoughtful questions, mutual enthusiasm. Then came Monday morning's polite rejection.

What I discovered in reflecting on that conversation changed how I think about leadership interviews entirely.

I'd been answering the questions I wanted them to ask, not the ones they were actually asking. When they asked about handling underperformance, I heard "How do you develop people?" They meant "Will you fire people when we tell you to?"

The gap between those two questions revealed everything about misaligned frequencies in how we define leadership.

This reflection explores the disconnect between what we say we want in leaders and what we actually hire for. It's about the difference between managing performance and cultivating capability. Between control and connection. Between authority and trust.

"Sometimes the interview isn't an audition. It's a mirror. It shows you not how well you performed, but how clearly you've defined your own frequency."

The manager asks: "How do I make people do their best work?"
The leader asks: "How do I create conditions where people can't help but do their best work?"

Different approaches. Different frequencies entirely.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
