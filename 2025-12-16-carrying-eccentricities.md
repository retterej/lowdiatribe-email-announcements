Hi {{firstName}},

I was eighteen years old, standing in an oversized suit and combat boots at a gala for the science museum where I'd volunteered through high school. A board member looked at me — shaved sides, long top, post-punk aesthetic — and asked Doc why they'd hired me as the new Explainer Coordinator.

Doc didn't hesitate: "There's a direct correlation between the amount of eccentricities tolerated and the talent of an individual. As you can see, this young man is very talented."

That moment taught me something I've carried for thirty-five years: being yourself isn't free. It costs credibility, attention, patience from others. Your skill has to be strong enough to carry the extra load.

The exchange rate is continuous. You don't earn the right to be yourself once and keep it forever. Every new context, every new role, every new team resets the equation. You have to prove the capability before you can spend it on authenticity.

This week's reflection explores the physics of earned eccentricity — how talent creates the conditions where difference can survive, the danger of mistaking correlation for causation, and the gap between having earned something and feeling like you've earned it.

I've watched people get this backwards. They see successful people who are authentically themselves and conclude that the difference is the source of the success. So they adopt the surface markers without building the underlying capability. They pick up weight they can't carry.

But there's another gap that's harder to see: the gap between earning capability and feeling like you've earned it. I had the skill at eighteen. Doc saw it. The board member eventually saw it. I'm still waiting to feel it.

The feeling doesn't catch up. What changes is your relationship to the gap — trusting the external signal more than the internal feeling, carrying the weight even when you don't feel ready, and recognizing when it's too heavy before you pick it up.
