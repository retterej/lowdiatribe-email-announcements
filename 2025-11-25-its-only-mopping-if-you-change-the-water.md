Hi {{firstName}},

We've all seen someone mopping a floor with water that's long past clean. They might be working hard, moving fast, sweating even — but the floor's not getting cleaner. They're just pushing the dirt around.

There's a leadership lesson buried in this simple observation about effort versus impact.

Our latest reflection explores why most organizational "change" is just motion without progress. I live in a 30-year-old log cabin with rough plank floors, and when I really need to clean them, I've learned it requires a constant supply of clean water and a wet-dry vac to remove the slop. No amount of effort with dirty water will do the job.

We reward motion because it looks like progress. But without changing the water — without resetting the conditions we're working in — it's just effort without impact. Meetings about accountability that never touch structure. Training programs that don't change incentives. Retrospectives that collect lessons no one applies.

In leadership, this means naming what's muddying the work — old assumptions, burned-out processes, unspoken resentments — and refreshing them before you keep scrubbing. You can reorganize teams all you want, but if the underlying trust issues remain, you're just moving the dysfunction around, you're just spreading the dirt.

Personal growth works the same way. You can read every book, take every course, adopt every tool — but if you're running on stagnant beliefs about your own capabilities or worth, you're only polishing the same dirty floor. The techniques might change, but the fundamental limitations stay put.

Culture is where this shows up most clearly: the difference between meetings that push progress and dogmatic ritual, the difference between reflection and repetition, learning and looping, or teams that grow and teams that just look busy. Real cultural change requires examining the unspoken rules that actually govern behavior, not just updating the values poster in the break room.

"Progress starts with clear conditions, not additional effort."
