Hi {{firstName}},

I'm generally a fan of duck typing. Identity revealed by behavior. If it looks like a duck and moves like a duck and quacks like a duck, treat it like a duck.

We have Muscovy ducks at our house. They walk like ducks. They mostly look like ducks. But they don't quack — they make a weird little warbling hiss instead. They technically fail the duck test. I still tend to call them ducks.

Chico Marx saw this coming: "Why a duck? Why not a chicken?" It's a joke. It's also the question we stop asking once a framework starts feeling true.

This week's reflection explores what happens when we forget we're making a choice — when we stop checking whether the pattern still fits the moment.

Duck typing is what happens when we infer identity from behavior. Blob typing happens when we forget we're making a choice. The context shifts and we're left holding a category that no longer fits.

I thought I was being an ant. I thought I was being a hedgehog. But that's not typing. That's type casting. Typing infers identity from behavior. Casting tries to force an outcome by emulating the behavior.

I chose the hedgehog approach this year, driven by an ant-like determination. I went all in on one big thing: finding a role aligned with how I actually lead — quiet authority, long horizons, systems built on trust rather than theatrics.

It was principled. It was also unnatural. I'm a fox by nature — responsive, flexible, comfortable with many things at once.

What I misjudged wasn't the value of alignment. It was assuming alignment would be legible, timely, and reciprocated within the available timeframe.

I was pouring ant-labor into a hedgehog task. The market was moving. I stayed committed to the plan without adjusting for the shift.

Blob typing fails the same way. We assume the category will hold. Then the context changes and the typing system breaks — not because we misread the behavior, but because we stopped checking whether the environment still supports the inference.

Duck typing works only if you keep asking: Why a duck? Why not a chicken?

Emulating an ant refined how I build. Emulating a hedgehog taught me deep focus. Being a fox comes naturally. Emulating a hedge-ant taught me that it's necessary to be a fox from time to time.

If I was going to emulate anything, it should have been a honey badger. It doesn't fit the fables. It works in the present. It figures out its next step, then makes it, regardless of obstacles.

These are all just stories — idealized for illustration, not instruction manuals for living. Reality requires checking whether the pattern still fits the moment.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
