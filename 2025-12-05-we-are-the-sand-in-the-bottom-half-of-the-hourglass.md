Hi {{firstName}},

Growing up, I heard it every weekday: "Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives." For years, I accepted the metaphor without question — time as sand, finite and falling, each grain slipping away into the past.

This week's reflection reimagines the hourglass. What if we are only ever conscious of the bottom half? What if the top isn't a fixed chamber slowly emptying, but a scoop — wide open to the cosmos, funneling through what's still possible?

We live in the accumulation. The sand that has already fallen. The experiences that have settled into us, grain by grain, forming the foundation of who we are. Everything we are comes from what has already landed. That's where weight lives. That's where resonance forms.

The reflection explores how leadership works in this system. It's not about holding the sand in suspension — it's about guiding the flow. Learning to widen the scoop so more people, more perspectives, more possibilities can flow through. To expand capacity without losing integrity.

When the funnel narrows, only the familiar passes through. But when it widens — through trust, through curiosity, through vulnerability — more voices, more perspectives, more of what we didn't know we needed gets through.

The leaders I aspire to be like didn't manage the sand. They tended the hourglass itself.
