New reflection: We are the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass

## Email Body

Hi {firstName},

Growing up, I heard it every weekday: "Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives."

For years, I accepted the metaphor without question. Time as sand, finite and falling, each grain a day slipping away into the past.

But I've been thinking about that hourglass lately — really thinking about it — and I've realized that we are only ever conscious of the bottom half.

We live in the accumulation. The sand that has already fallen. The experiences that have settled into us, grain by grain, forming the foundation of who we are.

The top half? We can't see it. We imagine it as a fixed chamber, slowly emptying — time running out, possibility diminishing. But what if it isn't fixed at all?

What if the top of the hourglass is a scoop — wide open to the cosmos, funneling through what's still possible?

I've started to notice how leadership works in this system. It's not about holding the sand in suspension — it's about guiding the flow. Learning to widen the scoop so more people, more perspectives, more possibilities can flow through.

When the funnel narrows, only the familiar passes through. But when it widens — through trust, through curiosity, through vulnerability — more voices, more perspectives, more of what we didn't know we needed gets through.

The leaders I aspire to be like didn't manage the sand. They tended the hourglass itself.
