subject: New reflection: Ted Lasso was wrong
---

Hi {{firstName}},

Sometimes the most dangerous frameworks aren't wrong—they're right just often enough to make you forget when they aren't. Our latest reflection explores the seductive trap of single-source wisdom through hiring mistakes, job search struggles, and the limits of even beautiful philosophies like Ted Lasso's relentless optimism. We examine why the leaders we most admire are philosophical omnivores who build toolkits rather than wielding single tools, and how authentic leadership requires the judgment to know which philosophy serves each moment.

"This is the danger of single-source wisdom: it gives you a hammer and makes everything look like a nail. Ted Lasso's approach is powerful, but it's not universal."

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
