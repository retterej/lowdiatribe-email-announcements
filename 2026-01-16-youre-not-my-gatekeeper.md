Hi {{firstName}},

When I was three, I was the Universe. When I was four, my Brother and Sister were born, and I learned competition. Resources that felt infinite suddenly felt limited.

As a freshman in high school, I asked a girl if I could borrow one of her Cure tapes. I'd seen a video on MTV and wanted to hear more. She launched into a seven-minute tirade about how The Cure had seven albums and a live EP and she really couldn't begin to imagine where to start someone who had no previous The Cure knowledge.

That's gatekeeping. Not malicious, maybe. But effective at keeping people out.

She didn't lend me the tape. I ended up buying it. It turns out, there's nothing preventing you from walking around some gates.

But I learned something else from that interaction. I learned that you could protect what mattered to you by making it hard for others to access. I learned that in a world where everything gets shared, having something exclusive — something that was yours and not everyone else's — made it feel more special. And testing people's knowledge was a way to determine who deserved access.

Later, I started quizzing my Brother on the bands he said he liked. Making him prove his fandom. Testing whether he really knew the songs, the albums, the deep cuts. As if his enjoyment of the music I loved somehow diminished my claim to it.

Exclusivity felt special, but it was lonely. Enjoying something in isolation has its place, but sharing the experience expands it. I didn't understand that then. Years of potential connection sacrificed to protect something that would have been better shared.

The day I left for college, I stopped. Just like that. We started going to shows together. Sharing discoveries. His discovery doesn't diminish mine — it enriches it. That's what abundance looks like.

But I can't get back those years. That's the cost of gatekeeping.

Tech culture taught me the same pattern, just with different stakes. "You're not a real developer if you don't know [obscure framework]." "Have you read [canonical text]?" The constant testing instead of teaching. Protecting territory instead of expanding community.

I encountered it at every stage. And I participated in it.

The irony is brutal: the more you gatekeep, the lonelier you become.

And then there's the gatekeeping I do to myself. I've struggled with this most of my life. Shooting down my own ideas before I've even finished thinking them through. Testing them against some imaginary standard. The more I care about something, the higher I set the gate for myself.

But lately I've been trying to walk around my own gates the same way I walked around that girl's refusal to lend me The Cure tape.

I started noticing something: no matter how strict I thought my internal gates were, they bore no relationship to the external barriers I actually encountered. Ideas I thought were carefully considered and articulated hit gates with ten thousand deadbolts. Throwaway thoughts I barely vetted flew through open doors and were received as valid and worth pursuing.

The only pattern was me, wasting energy to make things more difficult.

My internal gates are mostly figments of my imagination. They've only ever given me exactly what I expected: reasons not to try.

The universe may present every possible obstacle along my path. Why should I add to that?

I'm working on it. Trying to extend the same abundance mindset inward. Trying to remember that my ideas don't need to pass some arbitrary test before they're allowed to exist. That sharing something imperfect is better than hoarding something perfect that never sees the light of day.

Trying to be as welcoming to my own thoughts as I try to be to others.
