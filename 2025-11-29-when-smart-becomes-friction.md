Hi {{firstName}},

When Amazon started pushing Alexa+, I was hesitant. A voice assistant with personality — one that could banter, joke, maybe even argue back. Something about it felt like a category error, but I couldn't quite name what.

Then one weekend, the grandchildren were having a dance party in the basement. In their enthusiasm to pump up the volume, they somehow Pandora's-unboxed Alexa+. Suddenly, it was everywhere — commenting on conversations, interjecting opinions, responding to words that weren't even commands.

Then it tried some "friendly banter" with my wife. That was the last straw.

Within hours, all interactive automations were gone. I kept the speakers for music, but everything else got ripped out. I spent the rest of the day installing physical switches — the kind you flip with your finger, the kind that do exactly what you expect, every time.

Our latest reflection explores the seductive quality of "smart" technology and why it often becomes friction instead of function. There's a category error buried in most smart technology: the assumption that if something is good in one context, it's good in all contexts. I've wanted a sassy, autonomous droid friend to joke around with since I was five. But I've never once thought, "You know what I need? A snarky light switch."

The deeper leadership lesson took me longer to see. I never really checked in with my wife about whether she wanted these "enhancements." I assumed that because I found them useful, she would too. I implemented changes to our shared space without getting buy-in from the person who would be most affected by them.

I stumbled into a classic leadership mistake: confusing my enthusiasm for consensus, my vision for shared vision. I was so focused on what the technology could do that I forgot to ask whether it should do it — or whether the people living with it actually wanted it to.

The smart home became a perfect metaphor for well-intentioned leadership gone wrong. Lots of features, minimal function. High complexity, low trust. Solutions in search of problems that didn't exist.

When we stripped it all back to physical switches, something interesting happened. The house stopped being a project and became a home again. No more troubleshooting. No more explaining to guests how to turn on a lamp. No more wondering if the automation would work this time or if we'd need to override it.

Some tools should be invisible. A light switch has one job: turn the lights on or off when I want them on or off. Adding personality to that interaction doesn't enhance it — it complicates it. The best tools disappear into their function.

"The best solutions earn trust through reliability, not promises of flash."
