Hi {{firstName}},

You know the shower phenomenon.

The water's too cold, so you turn the knob toward hot. Nothing happens immediately, so you turn it more. Still cold. You turn it again. Then suddenly—scalding. You overcorrect toward cold. Now it's freezing. You adjust back. Too hot again.

You're not fixing the problem. You're adding complexity through oscillation.

The issue isn't the system. It's the lag between input and feedback. The water takes time to travel through the pipes, to register the temperature change, to reach you. But you're reacting to what you feel right now, not accounting for what's already in motion.

I've watched this same pattern play out in leadership. In teams. In organizational change. Someone identifies a problem and makes an adjustment. When results don't appear immediately, they adjust again. And again. Each correction compounding the last, until the system is oscillating wildly between extremes.

This week's reflection explores system lag, leadership patience, and the discipline of waiting. The team isn't responding fast enough, so we add more check-ins. Still not seeing results, so we add more structure. Now people feel micromanaged, so we pull back entirely. Now there's no accountability. We swing back the other way.

We're not managing the system. We're destabilizing it.

The problem isn't the adjustments themselves. It's the failure to account for lag. Systems have inertia. Changes take time to propagate. Feedback loops aren't instantaneous.

I've learned that the hardest part of leadership isn't making adjustments. It's waiting to see if they work. That pause—between action and reaction—is where most leaders lose their nerve. The discomfort of not knowing whether the change is working. The pressure to do something, anything, to show progress. The fear that waiting means accepting failure.

But sometimes the most important thing you can do is nothing. Let the system stabilize. Let the change propagate. Give the feedback loop time to complete.

Oscillation feels like responsiveness. It feels like you're engaged, attentive, adaptive. But what it actually creates is harmonic dissonance. People can't find their footing when the ground keeps shifting. Teams can't build momentum when the direction keeps changing.

The question I'm learning to ask isn't "what should I do?" but "is this a new problem, or am I just seeing the lag from the last adjustment?"

Usually, it's the lag.
