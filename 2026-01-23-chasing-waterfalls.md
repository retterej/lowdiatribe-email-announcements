Hi {{firstName}},

I've been job searching for months. Patient in the way you learn to be patient when there's no other choice.

Then a referral came through. The kind that makes you think: maybe this is it.

Friday: resume sent. Monday: HR call. Tuesday: hiring manager call. Wednesday: dying in anticipation.

Nothing had actually changed. I'd been waiting for months. But that steady progression tricked my nervous system into thinking bankable progress was being made.

That's when hope crept in. Not the careful, grounded kind. The dangerous kind. The kind that fabricates futures. I started imagining the perfect fit. The team. The work. The relief.

Thursday: boilerplate rejection.

The narrative I'd been building collapsed in a single sentence.

I started the familiar spiral. What did I miss. What could I have done differently. How could I make them see the future I saw.

That phrase hung there. Make them see. Like if I could just find the right words, they'd realize we were meant to be together.

I sounded like a schoolboy talking about a crush.

I was crushing on them. I'd been crushing on every company I interviewed with. Looking for the things I wanted to see.

Crushing on companies fueled the urgency with hope. The moment I started imagining the perfect fit, my nervous system set a deadline. Friday/Monday/Tuesday became "we'll be out by Christmas." Wednesday was Christmas Eve. Thursday was the day that Christmas didn't come.

The disappointment is the same every time.

The job search at this level is like a day at DisneyWorld with attendance at capacity. Four hours waiting in line for a 90-second ride that shuts down just when you're next.

That's what makes each "no" hurt. Not because that specific opportunity was special. Because it extends the timeline.

But I can stop fabricating futures. Stop crushing on companies.

Because somewhere along the way, I'd been so focused on the how that I forgot my why.

I've had a narrow view of what next steps should be. The default path: replicate and continue my career trajectory. I never really questioned it.

It's not a map I have to follow.

I like building software. I like building teams. I like building culture. The common why: building. I want to make my world better and enjoy doing it. How I get there can take many paths.

I just never gave myself permission to look.

The search continues. "No" only becomes "never" when you stop.

I'm done chasing waterfalls.
