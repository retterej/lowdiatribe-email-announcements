Hi {{firstName}},

We've entered the Hoth Era here — two significant snowfalls in as many weeks. Both times, the pattern has been identical.

The snow falls. I fishtail on the interstate. My hands grip the wheel. Every muscle tightens. For the rest of the day, I drive like my grandmother is in the passenger seat holding a tray of hot coffee with no lids.

Within 48 hours, the plows clear the roads. And I go back to giving driving just enough attention to get where I need to go.

Growing up in the midwest, driving is a way of life. I got my license as soon as the DMV opened on my 16th birthday. Nearly 40 years of positive reinforcement has ingrained a deep sense of "I know how." I've internalized the physics of the everyday.

And then the snow falls, and none of it works anymore. The physics I've spent two-thirds of my life internalizing are suddenly wrong. Every winter, it's like learning to drive all over again.

This is the pattern we live inside — not just on winter roads, but everywhere.

Crisis precipitates change. The emergency creates the conditions, the resolution removes them. We don't backslide because we're weak or lazy. We backslide because the environment that demanded vigilance no longer exists.

The question isn't how to stay in emergency mode forever — that's unsustainable and exhausting. The question is: what do we build while we're paying attention that can survive when we're not?

The vigilance will fade. That's not a failure — it's biology. But the systems we build while we're paying attention can outlast the attention itself.

Silvaris. Strength in quiet. Quiet as revolution.
