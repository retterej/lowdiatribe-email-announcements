Hi {{firstName}},

I've told the walking story before. How I wouldn't let anyone see me learning to walk. How I'd practice in secret, falling over and over, then sit back down the moment someone entered the room. How one day I just walked out, fully formed, like I'd known how all along.

I always thought the point of the story was about me. About perfectionism. About not wanting to be seen struggling. About the pattern I carried for decades: perfect it in private, only perform when polished.

But it occurs to me now, all these years later, that I only thought no one was watching.

Pops was watching.

---

He was hiding around the corner. Witnessing without interfering. Holding space for me to find my own way.

But it wasn't just that he was lurking there, waiting. Everything he did when he wasn't around the corner created the conditions that made it possible to wait around the corner.

He'd built trust. He'd been there consistently. He'd proven he was safe. So when I needed to feel alone to explore, I could feel alone without feeling abandoned. The foundation was already there.

"The watching wasn't the work. The work was everything that came before the watching."

There's a paradox here that I've only recently begun to understand. I needed to feel unwatched to try. The moment I knew someone was looking, I'd stop. Sit down. Pretend I wasn't attempting anything. The audience made the risk unbearable.

But I also needed him watching to be safe. Not just physically safe, though that too. Safe to fail. Safe to fall. Safe to struggle without it meaning something was wrong with me.

Pops created the conditions for me to feel alone enough to explore, while never being abandoned.

---

I've spent years thinking about the audience I feared. The judgment I was avoiding. The performance anxiety that kept me frozen.

But I misread the audience entirely. I assumed watching meant judging. That witness meant critic. That being seen meant being evaluated.

Pops was watching, but not like that. He was watching the way you watch a sunrise. Present. Attentive. Without needing it to be different than it is.

Struggle is learning, not failing. He saw me fall over and over, and he didn't see failure. He saw the process. He trusted it. That's the kind of witness I want to be.

---

I think about this now when I'm working with people who are learning something new. Who are trying something that scares them. Who are falling over and over in their own ways.

The instinct is to step in. To correct. To coach. To prevent the fall. To make it easier.

But sometimes the most supportive thing you can do is hide around the corner. Be present without being intrusive. Hold space without taking space.

There's an art to this kind of presence. Too far away, and it's abandonment. Too close, and it's pressure. Pops found the distance where I could feel alone enough to try, but held enough to be safe. The discipline of waiting to be asked.

---

I'm still that kid who doesn't want anyone to see him fall. But now I'm also trying to be the person around the corner. The one who watches without judging, who holds space without taking it, who trusts that struggle is teaching something I can't.

You can't just show up and hold space. The foundation has to be there first. The trust. The consistency. The proof that you're safe.

Pops could wait around the corner because he'd already done the work that made the corner safe.

Someone was watching. And that made all the difference.
